### Outline SDV602

The first week gone fast and I started off with the outline of my course. 

The first task of creating a presentation based on the content provided allows me and my teammate look into all aspect of the course oursevles with more details. As we need to present to the whole class so the information needed to be relevant and precise. It also trigger active learning which is students actively research and find the answer instead of just listen from the teacher.
