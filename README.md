# SDV602-Journal

The document will be update weekly and capture my experience as well as knowledge I learnt.

## Week 1 ü•á

### Outline SDV602

The first week gone fast and I started off with the outline of my course. 

The first task of creating a presentation based on the content provided allows me and my teammate look into all aspect of the course oursevles with more details. As we need to present to the whole class so the information needed to be relevant and precise. It also trigger active learning which is students actively research and find the answer instead of just listen from the teacher.

### Journal

![what I need to write](./src/content.png)

As this is my second year so It is normal for us to write journal. The content not only to show our progress but also record our knowledge base and improve our personal writing skills.

While it is make up to 10% of our total course which can be consider small, the journal is also an important part of this course as it is the personal relect and allow me to present my archivement in the future

### Project

#### Overview

Making up of 90% of the course, the project would be my main focus especial the first and second milestone as it is the foundation of my project and will contribute the to final product.

The final requirements for the project:

- provides live and interactive graphical displays (include chars)

- able to present different graphical views of data sources for a business or scientific analyst

- allow exploreation of data from a data source

- each Data Explorer Screens accpect text input and mouse click and displays brief description of relate to information displayed

- Accepct pointer input 

Some provided examples:

# Project Overview

For SDV602 2021 Project, I would like to use White shark tagging off new Zealand between April 2005 and September 2009 database

https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/white-shark-tagging-off-new-zealand-between-april-2005-and-september-20091
 The database would be useful to show to location of white shark sighting in New Zealand especially those hotspot where shark would appear frequently as well as tracking individual shark. At the moment the main source of data is from profession institution who actively research for the specie. 

The data base got the latitude and longitude of the sighting which could be presenting on map and divided into region or producing hotspot. 

The time stamp is also available in year like 2004, 2005... which can be useful to compare the changes between year. The data base also included description such as male, female, immature, adult as well as the length which could be added to DES when input new data.

The project could be develop to further tracking shark sighting  and other species of shark around New Zealand.

### Python

Python is an easy, general-purpose coding language designed with code readability through its notable use of significant indentation. As one of the high-level programming languages, it‚Äôs often used as an introductory language for college students and even universities would adopt the language for computer science courses. According to [Phillip Guo,](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext) In July 2014, Python is the most popular language in the top-ranked U.S department with eight of the top 10 CS departments and 27 of the top 39 teach Python in introductory CS0 or CS1 course

#### History

Python is created in 1980s by Guido van Rossum in Netherland as a successor to ABC programming language. He is  the lead developer for the project until 12 July 2018 when he resigned. During that time , he was given the title "Benevolent Dictator For Life" due to his long term commitment as the project's chief.

![Guido](./src/guido.jpg)

The first release of Python was in 1991 as Python 0.9 and its other versions, Python2 and 3 was released in 2000 and 2008.

Python 2.0 came with many major features such as cycle detecting garbage collector and support Unicode. The Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then changed into 2020 out of concern that a large portion of existing code could not be forward-ported to Python 3.

Python 3.0 came with a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.

### Setup Python (For Windows)

Installing Python is pretty straight forward

#### Step 1 Download Python

The coding language is free like most other so just need to download from the origininal website. If you need to pay or go to external source to download Python, I don't know what to say.

https://www.python.org/downloads/

While the latest version is the best option, depend on your works, you can also get the Python 2 from the website.

#### Optional

You can also install Python on the Window Store which would help with terminal and path.

![Window Store](./src/windowStore.jpg)

#### Step 2 installing pip and fix Path

This step could be extra if you following the install properly but in case pip just giving up on you or your PATH is broken here is some *personal* recommendations or fix I found.

##### The best option

The universal way to fix everything in technology world, re-install Python and also remember to tick the option to install PATH for you.

![tick that Path](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/_images/about_contribute_install_windows_installer.png)

##### Adding PATH when python cannot be located

- Add path for using Python in Bash

```bash
$ PATH=$PATH:/c/Python39/Scripts
$ PATH=$PATH:/c/Python39 (I store the Python in C:/)
```
* Note this is the temperary solution which suitable for virtual enviroment or one-time use code as the PATH will reset as soon as you terminate the code editor.

##### Install pip the hard way

download get-pip.py over [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#get-pip-py)

or here is the script for [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)

Then run 

```bash
$ python get-pip.py
```

##### Creating virtual enviroment

- install venv
  
  ```bash
  py -m pip install --user virtualenv
  ```
  
- inital venv
  
  ```bash
  py -m venv env
  ```
  
  env is the location to create virtual enviroment => this will      create in the project and call env

- deactive venv
  ```python
  deactive
  ```

### Data type

Here is a table of the most popular data type in Python:

| Data type | Mutability | Example and note                                             |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bool`    | immutable  | True, False <br/>The "T" and "F" need to be capitalize       |
| `string`  | immutable  | "name"                                                       |
| `dict`    | mutable    | {"key":1.9,3:False} <br/>The key value need to be immutable while the value can be both |
| `int`     | immutable  | 42                                                           |
| `complex` | immutable  | 3 + 2.7j<br />The j is the indicator for complex number      |
| `list`    | mutable    | [4, "string",True]                                           |
| `float`   | immutable  | 1.414                                                        |
| `None`    | immutable  | None<br />similar to null in other language                  |
| `range`   | immutable  | range(1,10)<br />A sequence of numbers using for looping     |
| `set`     | mutable    | {4, 'string',true}set()<br />unorderd, contain no duiplicates |
| `tuple`   | immutable  | (4,'string',True)                                            |
| `bytes`   | immutable  | bytes([119,105,107,105])                                     |

### Boolean Operations

| Operation | Notes                                                        | In Javascript |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `x and y` | The code will evaluates the `y` only if `x` is true. Some example<br /> `true and true == true ` <br /> `false and false ==false` <br /> `true and false ==false` | x && y        |
| `x or y`  | Opposite with `and` , `y` will be evaluated only if `x` is fail <br /> `true or true ==true` <br /> `false or true == true` <br /> `false or false == false` | x \|\| y      |
| `not x`   | while also boolean, `not` has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators so<br /> `not a==b`, `a==b` would be evaluated first before `not` which can be interpret as <br /> `not (a==b)` | !x            |

### Exercise - Fizzbuzz

Given the maximum number or in this case `up_to`, for each number from 0 to `up_to` is the number is 

#### version 1



#### version 2



#### version 3



#### Revision

The excersise helps me visualise the process to build a program from the inital requirements while also poiting out how to improve the resuablity as well as function wise.
