### Outline SDV602

The first week gone fast and I started off with the outline of my course. 

The first task of creating a presentation based on the content provided allows me and my teammate look into all aspect of the course oursevles with more details. As we need to present to the whole class so the information needed to be relevant and precise. It also trigger active learning which is students actively research and find the answer instead of just listen from the teacher.

### Journal

### Python

Python is an easy, general-purpose coding language designed with code readability through its notable use of significant indentation. As one of the high-level programming languages, itâ€™s often used as an introductory language for college students and even universities would adopt the language for computer science courses. According to [Phillip Guo,](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext) In July 2014, Python is the most popular language in the top-ranked U.S department with eight of the top 10 CS departments and 27 of the top 39 teach Python in introductory CS0 or CS1 course

#### History

Python is created in 1980s by Guido van Rossum in Netherland as a successor to ABC programming language. He is  the lead developer for the project until 12 July 2018 when he resigned. During that time , he was given the title "Benevolent Dictator For Life" due to his long term commitment as the project's chief.
